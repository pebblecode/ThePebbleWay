h1. The Pebble Way

bq. "Simple software that solves difficult problems"
-- pebble {code} website (2012)

This document defines what we at pebble {code} believe is the correct way to develop .NET software. 
It starts from the assumption that the team is smart, motivated and _passionate_ about software development. Therefore 
it is not an attempt to prevent a weak team from causing damage; it is a set of guidelines that can:

* Help smart people come up with the correct solutions to the problems they face whilst developing software.
* Encourage creativity and risk-taking by providing a safety net that detects problems early and limits their impact.
* Allow people to move between projects by reducing the learning curve to the bare minimum.

It is heavily based on the ideas in "Simple Made Easy"[1]. Make sure you have watched that video before proceeding with the rest of this document.

Firstly, all software development is a design activity[2], and simplicity lies at the heart of all principles and guidelines for software design. 
Rather than trying to list out everything that we believe we should be doing (which is an impossible task because the 
correct approach is always context-dependent), _analyzing the problem from the perspective of simplicity can provide a 
way to arrive at the correct solution_. However, we typically conflate the meaning of "easy" and "simple", so the first 
step is to clearly differentiate the two terms so that we can have meaningful conversations:

* Easy = "familiar, near-at-hand, close to our capabilities" (the opposite being "hard")
* Simple = "one fold or braid" (the opposite being "complex", meaning "braided together, entwined")
* Simplicity is often hard to achieve
* Simple things are _always_ easy to use

Secondly, we are blind to a lot of the complexity because it is so familiar to us. Many of our current standard software 
development practices originated over 20 years ago, and are optimised to deal with far more onerous constraints (both in 
terms of hardware and software) than we face today. As a result, these practices often introduce significant accidental 
complexity into our solutions. _We need to be open to investigating the new approaches that will become dominant in the 
next decade_.

Thirdly, we need to be clear about who the user is, as they (*not* us) will judge our efforts. For a UI, it is the human interacting 
with it; for an API, it is the client application; for a component, it is the next programmer who needs to understand it, etc. 
_Then we need to figure out how best to communicate with that user (again using simplicity as a guide)_.

h1. Some Concrete Guidelines

These guidelines will evolve over time. At any point any team member can suggest a change, and if the team agrees then the change is adopted. 
_However, nobody is allowed to unilaterally ignore them_. The guidelines have been categorised 
(idea stolen from "Framework Design Guidelines"[3]) into:

* Do
** Something that we feel is extremely important to do. 
** There will only be _very rare_ exceptions, and these need to be discussed by the _whole project team_.
* Consider
** Something that is our default approach, but we sometimes choose not to do when we understand the implications. 
** These exceptions must be discussed in an _early code/design review_.
* Avoid
** Something that we try not to do, but may sometimes choose to when we understand the implications. 
** These exceptions must be discussed in an _early code/design review_.
* Don't
** Something that we feel is extremely bad practice. 
** There will only be _very rare_ exceptions, and these need to be discussed by the _whole project team_.


h2. Do 

* Use simplicity as the primary metric when evaluating competing options
* Write self explanatory code
* Write readable unit tests
* Automate repetitive tasks

h4. Documentation

* Document all major design decisions[4]
* Add a single sentence XML code comment to the top of classes you write or touch
** Being forced to describe the single responsibility of a class can be a useful design aid
* Keep high level diagrams up to date
* Add a project level README.md to explain the role of a project
* Ensure that acceptance criteria are clearly identified before starting work on a story

h4. Reviews 

* Get a code review when you think you've finished implementation
* Guide reviews using SOLID[5] principles
* Start reviews with unit tests
** Lack of unit tests is an immediate failure of the review
** A reviewer should be able to infer the single responsibility of a class from the test suite

h4. Build/Deploy

* Keep the build green at all costs
** Panic when the build goes red - establish who is working to resolve the issue
* Prioritise fixing the build over finishing a story
* Treat build/deploy scripts as first class citizens
** The same rules and standards you apply to code apply to your scripts

h2. Consider

* Backing out changes that break the build
* Pursuing a functional approach - immutable types[6], pure functions[7] etc
* Asking for a design review at any point of working on a story
* Adding smoketests to validate components

h2. Avoid

* Complex solutions
** Only ignore this recommendation if the benefits are demonstrably overwhelming
* Constructing invalid objects
* Extensive usage of stubs and mocks in unit test setup
* Mutable objects

h2. Don't

* Disable any automated tests
* Be fooled by self explanatory easy to read code - it isn't necessarily SOLID
* Test multiple scenarios in a single unit test
* Repeat yourself!
